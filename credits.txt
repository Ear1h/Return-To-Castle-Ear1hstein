Description             : You have been sent to one of the classified castles
                          in Germany, where they are conducting
                          archaeological excavations inside underground
                          citadels. 
                          
                          Unfortunately, there is very little information
                          about the citadels. The only thing we know about it
                          is that legend has it that it was built not by man,
                          but by the devil.
                          
                          To fight the evil, you are warned that there is a
                          shotgun nearby that can crush anyone who gets in
                          your way, but the specific location is unknown
